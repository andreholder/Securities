# Securities

The goal of this code is to create different degress of noise in demographic data from the file ""adult_age_gender_race_dataset.csv", then
demonstrate a decreasing relationship between error (the difference between the frequency of each attribute's value and that which has been 
introduced to noise) and epsilon (a measure of the amount of noise that is added.

You will need to download the securitiesScript, and the csv fils containing the data. They must both be in the same folder for this to work.
